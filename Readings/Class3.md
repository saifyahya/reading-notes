 ## Primitives vs. Objects
 - **Primitives**: basic data types stores values directly, example: int, double, char, float, etc.
 - **Objects**: they are references for the primitives, wrapper classes, example: Integer, Double.

 ## Difference between primitives and objects
 | Primitives | Objects (References) |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Lives in stack | Lives in heap |
| Fast to access | Slow to access  |
| Default value 0 | Default value null |

- **Autoboxing**: the process of convert a primitive type to a reference type.
- **Unboxing**: the process of convert a reference type to a primitive type.

## Exceptions
1. Checked exception
2. The error
3. The runtime exception
- The *try*, *catch*, and *finally* blocks, and *throw* are used to write an exception handler.

## Scanner
- A usefull situation to use *Scanner* : text-based user interface or a command-line tool that interacts with users.
- The input from a *Scanner* is broken down into individual tokens. Tokens are the smallest meaningful units of data that are separated by specific delimiters. Delimiters are characters or sequences of characters that define the boundaries between tokens. By default, the Scanner class uses whitespace characters (such as spaces, tabs, and line breaks) as delimiters, but you can customize the delimiter pattern to suit your needs.
