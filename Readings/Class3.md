 ## Primitives vs. Objects
 - Primitives: basic data types stores values directly, example: int, double, char, float, etc.
 - Objects: they are references for the primitives, wrapper classes, example: Integer, Double.

 ## Difference between primitives and objects
 | Primitives | Objects (References) |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Lives in stack | Lives in heap |
| Fast to access | Slow to access  |
| Default value 0 | Default value null |

- **Autoboxing**: the process of convert a primitive type to a reference type.
- **Unboxing**: the process of convert a reference type to a primitive type.
