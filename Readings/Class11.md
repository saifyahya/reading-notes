## Spring App Basics
- *@Controller classes*: this annotation is responsible for processing user requests, interacting with the model (business logic and data), and selecting an appropriate view to render the response. It essentially acts as a bridge between the client's request and the application's business logic and views.

- *GET* request:  example: if you request something from a website, like "Show me pictures of Tailand" In the internet world, this is similar to what we call a "GET request." It's like politely asking a website for information, and the website responds by giving you the pictures you asked for.

-  For your Spring Boot application class, you should place the *@SpringBootApplication* annotation on it. This annotation tells Spring Boot that this class is the starting point of your application, and it should configure and run your application accordingly. 

- To display a variable defined in a Java Spring Controller in HTML with the help of Thymeleaf, you can use Thymeleaf expression syntax within your HTML templates. Specifically, you would use `${variableName}` to reference the Java variable in your Thymeleaf template.

- In a Spring MVC application, a @Controller class plays the role of handling HTTP requests and generating responses. It serves as a part of the controller layer in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. The @Controller class is responsible for processing user requests, interacting with the model (business logic and data), and selecting an appropriate view to render the response. It essentially acts as a bridge between the client's request and the application's business logic and views.

- In Thymeleaf, a model attribute refers to a variable or data object that is added to the model in a Spring Controller. These model attributes are accessible in Thymeleaf templates using Thymeleaf expression syntax, such as `${attributeName}`, and they allow you to display dynamic data in HTML templates generated by Thymeleaf.
