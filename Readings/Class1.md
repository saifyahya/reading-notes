1. What does "strong typed" mean?
means that variables must have a declared data type before they can be assigned values. This type checking is performed at compile-time, allowing the compiler to catch type-related errors before the program is run.For example, if you declare a variable as an integer, you cannot assign a string value to it. This helps to prevent errors such as type mismatches, which can lead to bugs and crashes in your code.

2. What are the primitive data types?
1. byte: 8-bit signed integer 
2. short: 16-bit signed integer 
3. int: 32-bit signed integer 
4. long: 64-bit signed integer 
5. float: 32-bit floating-point number 
6. double: 64-bit floating-point number 
7. char: 16-bit Unicode character 
8. boolean: Represents true or false values

3. Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript
In Java, code is first translated into a low-level format called bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In contrast, JavaScript is directly interpreted by the browser or server without a separate compilation step.

4. Does code complaining mean that it works correctly?
No, code compilation does not guarantee that the code will work correctly, it ensures that there are no syntax errors but dosen't guarantee the logic of the code.

5. How many keywords does Java have?
52 keywords

6. How do you print words to the console in Java?
 System.out.println("Hello, world!");
