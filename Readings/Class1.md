- **strong typed** meaning:
It means that variables must have a declared data type before they can be assigned values. This type checking is performed at compile-time, allowing the compiler to catch type-related errors before the program is run.For example, if you declare a variable as an integer, you cannot assign a string value to it. This helps to prevent errors such as type mismatches, which can lead to bugs and crashes in your code.

- *Primitive* data types:
1. byte: 8-bit signed integer 
2. short: 16-bit signed integer 
3. int: 32-bit signed integer 
4. long: 64-bit signed integer 
5. float: 32-bit floating-point number 
6. double: 64-bit floating-point number 
7. char: 16-bit Unicode character 
8. boolean: Represents true or false values

- Difference between compilation in Java and JavaScript:
In Java, code is first translated into a low-level format called bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In contrast, JavaScript is directly interpreted by the browser or server without a separate compilation step.

- code compilation does not guarantee that the code will work correctly, it ensures that there are no syntax errors but dosen't guarantee the logic of the code.

- *Java* has 52 keywords.

- To print words to the console in Java?
 System.out.println("Hello, world!");
