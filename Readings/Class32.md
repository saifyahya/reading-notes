- What makes an API RESTful?

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is a set of constraints and principles for designing networked applications. To be considered RESTful, an API should adhere to the following key principles:

a. Statelessness: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. The server doesn't store any client state between requests. This simplifies server implementation and allows for easy scalability.

b. Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities that interact through API requests. This separation allows for better separation of concerns and scalability.

c. Uniform Interface: REST APIs should have a uniform and consistent set of rules for interactions. This includes the use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and the use of resource URIs to address resources.

d. Resource-Based: Resources, such as data objects or entities, are the focal point of RESTful APIs. Each resource is identified by a unique URI, and clients can interact with these resources using HTTP methods.

e. Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML. Clients can request a specific representation of a resource based on their needs.


- Benefits of using GraphQL and downsides:

Benefits of GraphQL:

- Flexible Queries: With GraphQL, clients can request exactly the data they need, and nothing more. This can reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data, making responses more efficient.
- Reduced Overhead: Unlike REST APIs, which often require multiple requests to fetch related data, GraphQL can retrieve all related data in a single query. This reduces the number of round trips between the client and server.
- Strong Typing: GraphQL allows developers to define types and schemas, making it easier to understand and work with the API. Clients can validate their queries against the schema to catch errors early.
- Versioning and Evolution: GraphQL APIs can evolve without breaking existing clients, as clients request the specific fields they need, and new fields can be added without affecting existing queries.

Downsides of GraphQL:

- Complexity: GraphQL queries can become complex, and it might be challenging to optimize and control query depth and breadth, potentially leading to performance issues.
- Caching: Caching GraphQL responses can be more challenging than caching REST responses, as the structure of the data may vary depending on the query.
- Learning Curve: Adopting GraphQL may require a learning curve for developers who are used to working with REST APIs.

- Describing "serverless":

Serverless computing, also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), is a cloud computing model that allows developers to build and run applications without managing traditional server infrastructure. Here's a simple explanation for a new 301 Code Fellows student:

"Imagine you're building a web application, and traditionally, you'd need to rent or provision servers to run your code. You'd have to worry about their configuration, scaling, and maintenance. With serverless, you write your code as small, self-contained functions or services, and then you upload them to a cloud provider like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions. These cloud providers take care of running your code for you. When your application needs to perform a specific task, the cloud provider automatically runs the corresponding function, and you're only charged for the time your code is running. It's like outsourcing the server management part, allowing you to focus on writing code and building your application, while the cloud provider takes care of the server infrastructure behind the scenes."
