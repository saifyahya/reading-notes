## Objects and Classes
- **Class:**
- A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.
- It serves as a blueprint for creating objects.
- It defines attributes (data members or fields) and methods (functions) that the objects of the class will have.
- **Object:**
- An object is an instance of a class, created based on the blueprint provided by the class.
- It represents a real-world entity or concept.
- Objects have state (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by the class.

- Example of 2 Types of State for a Student Object:
*Name*, *Age*
- Example of two types of behaviours that a student object might have:
*attendClass()*, *passExams()*

- A **constructor** in a class is a special method that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. It has the responsibility of initializing the object's attributes and performing any setup that is required for the object to be in a valid and usable state. 
- Example of Student class: public class Student{}
