## Terminal Tutorial
- The tutorial provides an introduction to Linux and its directory system. It explains how the Linux file system works and how to navigate through it.
- You will learn about the characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment, gaining insights into their properties.
- The tutorial teaches you how to use manual pages effectively, allowing you to make the most of the Linux commands you learn.
- You'll also discover file manipulation techniques, including creating, removing, renaming, copying, and moving files and directories.

1. The Command Line:
- The command line is a text-based interface in which you can interact with a computer's operating system by entering commands.
- It allows you to perform various tasks, execute programs, and manage files and directories using text-based commands.
- To access the command line, you typically open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2. Basic Navigation:
- The Linux directory system is a hierarchical structure where files and directories are organized.
- You navigate through directories using commands like cd (change directory) and ls (list files and directories).
- The root directory is denoted by "/", and relative paths (from the current location) and absolute paths (from the root) are used to specify locations.

3. More About Files:
- Files and directories in Linux have various attributes, including permissions, ownership, size, and timestamps.
- File types are indicated by symbols like "-" for regular files, "d" for directories, "l" for symbolic links, and more.
- File and directory names are case-sensitive, and certain characters have special meanings.

4. Manual Pages:
- Linux provides manual pages (man pages) for commands, offering detailed information on usage, options, and examples.
- You can access man pages using the man command followed by the command name, like man `ls`.

5. File Manipulation:
- Creating files and directories is done with commands like `touch`, `mkdir`, and removing with `rm` (be cautious with this command).
- Renaming files/directories uses `mv`, copying uses `cp`, and moving uses `mv` as well.
- These commands can be combined with options to modify behavior (e.g., recursive copying with `cp -r`).

6. Cheat Sheet:
- A cheat sheet provides a quick reference to key commands and concepts covered in the tutorial.
- It's a helpful tool to review and remember essential information without going through the entire tutorial again.
