## OAuth

- OAuth is a security framework that allows your application to securely access information or services from other websites or platforms without needing to store user passwords. It provides a way for your app to request permission from users to access their data on another platform, such as logging in with their *Google* or *GitHub* accounts. OAuth ensures that the user's credentials are kept safe and allows your app to interact with other services on their behalf.

- The tutorial covers authentication providers such as *GitHub* and *Google*. It demonstrates how to integrate OAuth 2.0 authentication with these providers into your Spring Boot application, allowing users to log in using their GitHub or Google accounts.
