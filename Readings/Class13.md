## *One to Many* Relationship

- Real-life examples of "One To Many" relationships:
Parking and Cars: One parking can contain many cars.
University and Departments: One university can have multiple departments.
Class and Students: One class can have many students in a class.

- In a one-to-many relationship between Player and Team:
The *one* side would typically be the Team, one team can have multiple players.
The *many* side would be the Player, each player belongs to one team.

- Explaining one-to-many relationships to a non-technical friend:
Imagine you have a classroom. In this classroom, there is one teacher, and the teacher has many students. This is an example of a one-to-many relationship. One teacher can teach multiple students in the same class. So, in this case, the teacher is the "one," and the students are the "many." It's like a teacher being in charge of a group of students in a class.
