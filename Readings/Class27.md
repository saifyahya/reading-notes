## Android SharedPreferences
A technology similar to Shared Preferences is "localStorage" in web development. Both are used for storing small amounts of data locally, accessible across sessions, and primarily used for settings or user preferences.

## Espresso Testing
Testing is essential for the following reasons:
a. Bug Identification: Testing helps find and fix software defects or bugs before they impact users.
b. Quality Assurance: It ensures that the software meets quality standards and specifications.
c. Improved User Experience: Testing enhances the user experience by identifying and fixing issues that could frustrate or confuse users.
d. Cost Savings: Detecting and addressing issues early in the development process is more cost-effective than fixing them post-release.

The most important reason for testing, to me, is improved user experience. Ensuring that software is intuitive, reliable, and free from errors directly benefits users and builds trust in your product.

## Tasks and the back stack in Android 
An analogy for Tasks and the back stack in Android is similar to a stack of plates. When you place a new plate on top of the stack, it represents starting a new activity. Removing the top plate is like navigating back to the previous activity. This analogy reflects the Last In, First Out (LIFO) behavior of the back stack.

We've used a similar system in our daily lives when stacking physical items, such as books or dishes, where the last item added is the first one removed. It's a practical way to organize and manage a collection of items.
