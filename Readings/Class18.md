## Many-To-Many Relationship
- Examples: 
*Employees and Projects*, one Employee can do many projects and one project can be done by many employees. 
*Authors and Books*, one author can do contribute in many books and one book can have many authors. 

- Join Table is important in `Many-To-Many` relationship as each side of the relation can have many items of the other side, so the joining table uses a foreign keys from both tables to connect each side with the other.

- Join Table contains foreign keys from both tables which represent the primary key in each table to represent the item.

## Security
- The article suggests that achieving absolute security from ALL possible security threats is highly unlikely and perhaps even impractical. The author emphasizes that security researchers often focus on complex and unlikely threats, creating elaborate security models and solutions. However, these efforts may not address the more common and practical security issues that individuals and organizations face.

 - There should be balanced with practicality and common sense. Achieving perfect security is challenging, and it may involve trade-offs between convenience and protection. The author implies that the pursuit of absolute security can sometimes lead to overcomplicated solutions that may not be effective in the real world.
