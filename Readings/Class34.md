- How are releases and versioning related?

In software development, releases and versioning are closely related concepts. A release represents a specific version of a software product that is made available to users. Versioning is the practice of assigning unique identifiers (versions) to different states of the software during its development.

Typically, a version number consists of a series of digits or strings separated by dots, such as "1.0" or "2.1.3." Each release is associated with a specific version number, and as the software evolves through development, new features, bug fixes, or improvements may be implemented, leading to the creation of a new version.

The version number is crucial for tracking changes, communicating updates to users, and ensuring compatibility. Common versioning schemes include semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch), where a change in the major version indicates backward-incompatible changes, a change in the minor version indicates backward-compatible additions, and a change in the patch version indicates backward-compatible bug fixes.

- What are the 5 main tasks you need to complete to prepare your application for release to the Google Play Store?

1. Configure Your App:
 Disable logging and remove debugging information.
Set appropriate flags for release builds (e.g., debuggable false for Groovy or isDebuggable = false for Kotlin script).
Update version information, including the version code and version name.

2. Build and Sign a Release Version:
Use Gradle build files with the release build type to generate a release version of your app.
Sign the release version with a private key to ensure its authenticity.

3. Test the Release Version:
Thoroughly test the release version on at least one target handset and one target tablet device.
Utilize tools like Firebase Test Lab to test across a variety of devices and configurations.

4. Update App Resources for Release:
Ensure all app resources, including multimedia files and graphics, are up-to-date and included in the release version.
Verify that everything is ready for distribution or staging on production servers.

5. Prepare Remote Servers and Services:
If your app relies on external servers or services, make sure they are secure, reliable, and production-ready.
Ensure any backend infrastructure is prepared for the release version of the app.
