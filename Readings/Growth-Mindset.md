## The Growth Mindset
This topic is very important with regards to what I'm learning in this module, since it focuses in increasing your technical skills and your mind abilities and thinking. It helps you to efficiently emphasize learning abilities, and how to overcome the problems you face in learning and achieving your goals.

- Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice:
Merely working on software daily doesn't guarantee skill improvement. Deliberate practice involves pushing your boundaries, repeating tasks, seeking feedback, and setting tough goals. It's focused and mentally demanding, targeting specific areas of improvement. Unlike casual tasks, deliberate practice tackles the toughest parts. In software development, it helps learn new techniques, solve complex problems, and gain deep understanding. Regularly challenging yourself with well-designed exercises can significantly enhance your technical skills and broaden your capabilities.

- The Growth Mindset:
The growth mindset, coined by Carol Dweck, centers on "yet." Students failing a course receive a "Not Yet," encouraging them to view challenges as learning opportunities. Growth mindset students embrace challenges, believing abilities can develop, unlike fixed mindset peers who fear failure. Fostering growth mindset leads to embracing mistakes, learning, and resilience. Praise for effort and improvement, not just talent, builds this mindset, transforming students' outlooks, improving academics, and promoting equality in education.

- Duckworth on Grit:
Angela Lee Duckworth found IQ alone doesn't determine success. Grit, passion, and perseverance for long-term goals, emerged as a key predictor. Gritty individuals persist for years, achieving through relentless effort. While the importance of grit is clear, building it lacks comprehensive understanding. A growth mindset might help, emphasizing learning abilities improve with effort. Duckworth stresses the need for research to cultivate grit in students.

- Redefining Success:
Alain de Botton explores modern success's impact on our lives. Career crises and anxiety stem from gaps between hopes and reality. Snobbery and job snobbery cause pressure. Meritocracy, valuing talent and effort, leads to envy. Nature offers escape. Redefining success based on personal values, not societal pressures, brings true fulfillment and happiness.
