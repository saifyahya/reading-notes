## Data Structures and Algorithims
Data structures are on of the most important topics when dealing with data, because they specify how the data is stored, accessed and the operations that can be done on it. Data structures help in solving problems and using algorithims.

- Selecting the suitable data structure is the key to get the best performance and solutions. It depends on the requirement of the solution, and there are sompe points that must be consedered when choosing the data structure:
1. adding items.
2. getting items.
3. sorting items.
4. searching for an item.

## Recursion
Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem or perform a task. It's a powerful technique used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem.
A recursive function has two main components:

1. Base Case: This is the point where the function stops call itself again and returns a result directly. It's essential to have a base case in order to prevent *infinite* recursion.
2. Recursive Case: This is where the function calls itself with modified arguments to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. The recursive call works towards reaching the base case.
