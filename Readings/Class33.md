## Asynchronous  Actions
They are actions that are not dependent on each other and may take some time for execution. Example: if you order a food from the resturant, other people can also order their food and they will not wait until your order is ready.

## Benefits of Asynchronous  Methods
An asynchronous method is a type of function that allows a program to run without waiting for the result. It is a non-blocking method, which means that when the function is called, the program continues to execute while the function is running.

1. Allowing multiple tasks to be performed at the same time, so increase performance and scalability.
2. Allowing programs to be more efficient, because they can execute multiple tasks simultaneously.
3. Imporoving user experience by allowing a program to respond to user input instantly.
4. Improving program security, they can be used to isolate sensitive data from other tasks.
5. Reducing the risk of data loss, since they can be used to store data in multiple locations.
